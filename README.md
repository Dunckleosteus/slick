This is a project aiming to detect oil leaks in the ocean using Landsat 5 data
# The oil leak
Deepwater Horizon oil spill, largest marine oil spill in history, caused by an April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig—located in the Gulf of Mexico, approximately 41 miles (66 km) off the coast of Louisiana—and its subsequent sinking on April 22.

# Landsat data
I tried to use Landsat 8 data but there was missing data. For this project we have 3 images. The first image was taken 13 days before the accident, the second one was taken 19 days after the accident and the last one 30 days after the accident. 
# Goals
As an academic project this project has 2 main objectives: 
1. See which combinations work best for detecting the oil leak
2. Compare the evolution of oil spread over the time
# Data analysis
We tried various indices to see if any of them showed any promise in detecting the oil spill.
